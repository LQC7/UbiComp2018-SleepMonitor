Sleep is an important part of our daily routine -- we spend about one-third of our time doing it. By tracking the sleep-related events
and activities, sleep monitoring provides the decision support to help us understand the sleep quality and the causes of poor sleep.
Wearable devices provide a new way for sleep monitoring, allowing us to monitor sleep from the comfort of our own home, but existing
solutions do not take full advantage of the rich senor data provided by these portable devices. In this paper, we present {\systemname},
a smartwatch-based sleep monitor solution that can track an extensive set of sleep-related events. \systemname integrates a range of
analysis and algorithms to track and monitor events like sleep postures and movements, acoustic events during sleep, and illumination
conditions, many of these are not supported by prior solutions. From these events, a statistical model can then evaluate the user's sleep
quality across various sleep stages. We evaluate our approach by conducting extensive experiments on 10 users across a 2-week period. Our
experimental results show that \systemname can track a wider range of sleep-related events compared with the state-of-the-art
mobile-based sleep monitoring system.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented \systemname, the first holistic smartwatch-based sleep monitoring solution that can simultaneously estimate sleep quality and provide rich information about sleep events, including body motions, acoustic events related to sleep disorders, and ambient illumination. To capture this information accurately, we have proposed new algorithms for extracting the relevant events from sensor information. We demonstrated the benefits of \systemname through rigorous benchmark experiments carried out using measurements collected from a two week trial with $15$ participants. The results of our experiments demonstrate that \systemname provides comparable sleep quality estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art consumer grade sleep monitors, while at the same time being able to accurately capture a rich set of information about factors influencing sleep quality. This information is particularly important for identifying possible causes of poor quality sleep and can be used to provide the user with suggestions on how to improve their sleep quality, e.g., by improving their sleep environment or behaviours surrounding sleep. We also compared the sleep quality estimates of \systemname against subjective self assessments, demonstrating a high degree of correspondence. 

%This paper presents \systemname, a smartwatch based deep understanding of sleep detection system. \systemname exploits the rich sensor data
%provided by smartwatches to track a wider range of sleep-related activities. To detect sleep related activities, we effectively exploit the
%smartwatch sensor data and design a set of new algorithms based on the particular characteristics. Extensive experimental results show that
%\systemname can accurately identify lots of sleep activities, including body postures, body rollover, hand positions and acoustical events.
%In the future work, we will optimize the energy consumption and design detection models for more events.

\section{CONCLUSION}
This paper presents \systemname, a smartwatch based deep understanding of sleep detection system. \systemname exploits the rich sensor data
provided by smartwatches to track a wider range of sleep-related activities. To detect sleep related activities, we effectively exploit the
smartwatch sensor data and design a set of new algorithms based on the particular characteristics. Extensive experimental results show that
\systemname can accurately identify lots of sleep activities, including body postures, body rollover, hand positions and acoustical events.
In the future work, we will optimize the energy consumption and design detection models for more events.

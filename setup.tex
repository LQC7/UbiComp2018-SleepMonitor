\section{Experimental Setup}
{\systemname} is implemented on the HuaWei Smartwatch 2. The programming platform is JAVA. For simplification, we implement the event
detection on a laptop and the collected data is processed by MATLAB. In our experiments, we recruit 10 volunteers (3 males and 7 females).
Each volunteer is asked to wear a smartwatch on the his/her left hand during sleep. The experiments are conducted over two weeks. To test
the reliability of our methods, we use the video camera to monitor the sleep, and those recorded data by camera are set as groundtruth
during the experiment.

\FIXME{ZW: here we should detail our experimental setup e.g. the environmental settings, how do we recruit the users, the mixture of the
users, what are the competitive models that we compare with, how do we report data (e.g. do we apply any statistical methods to remove the
outliers?), etc.}

\section{Experimental Setup}
{\systemname} is implemented on the HuaWei Smartwatch 2. The programming platform is JAVA. For simplification, we implement the event detection on a laptop and the collected data is processed by MATLAB. In our experiments, we recruit 15 volunteers (6 males and 9 females) from 15 years old to 60 years old. According to our preliminary survey of participants, two of them were found to have long-term sleep disorders and  one participant have been troubled by snoring, and they are the focus of our attention. The experiments are conducted over two weeks, and during experiments, these volunteers sleep alone in a quiet room and each of them sleeps at least 6 hours. Moreover, each participant is asked to wear a smartwatch and Fitbit Charge2 \cite{fitbit} on his/her wrist simultaneously during sleep. And the smartphone with Sleep As Android \cite{SleepAndroid} is placed beside the participant¡¯s body. Considering that there is no absolute ground truth to detect sleep stage and the operations of other professional medical equipment are complicated, we leverage the result of Fitbit Charge2, a comfortable and effortless bracelet, as the ground truth. Sleep As Android, a widely used app for sleep detection, run the whole sleep process for comparing with our system. At the same time, to test the reliability of our methods, we use the video camera to monitor the sleep, and those recorded data by camera are set as groundtruth during the experiment. \textcolor{red}{Fig.00000} illustrates the experimental scene for our system.

\FIXME{ZW: here we should detail our experimental setup e.g. the environmental settings, how do we recruit the users, the mixture of the
users, what are the competitive models that we compare with, how do we report data (e.g. do we apply any statistical methods to remove the
outliers?), etc.}

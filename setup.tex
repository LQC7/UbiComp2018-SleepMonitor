\section{Evaluation Methodology}
\subsection{Implementation}
We prototype and evaluate \systemname on a Huawei Smartwatch 2 wearable device. The smartwatch is equipped with a Quad-core Cortex-A7
processor at 1.1 GHz.  It runs Android Wear 2.0 operating system. We use \FIXME{four} sensors provided by the smartwatch: the
accelerometer, gyro, and \FIXME{xx}. The collected sensor data are sent via Bluetooth to a XiaoMI Note2 Android smartphone for
post-processing and event detection.


\subsection{User Participation} We have recruited 15 volunteers to participate in our experiments. Our
participants include 6 males and 9 females at the age of between 15 and 60 years old. Two of our participants have been diagnosed with
long-term, on-going sleep-related disorders, and one participant has described that his sleep is significantly affected by snoring. These
three participants are our focus group.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
After obtaining IRB approval, we have conducted our experiments over a two-week period. During experiments, these volunteers sleep alone in
a quiet room and each of them sleeps at least 6 hours. Moreover, each participant is asked to wear a smartwatch and Fitbit Charge2
\cite{fitbit} on his/her wrist simultaneously during sleep. And the smartphone with Sleep As Android \cite{SleepAndroid} is placed beside
the participant's body. Considering that there is no absolute ground truth to detect sleep stage and the operations of other professional
medical equipment are complicated, we leverage the result of Fitbit Charge2, a comfortable and effortless bracelet, as the ground truth.
Sleep As Android, a widely used app for sleep detection, run the whole sleep process for comparing with our system. At the same time, to
test the reliability of our methods, we use the video camera to monitor the sleep, and those recorded data by camera are set as ground
truth during the experiment. \textcolor{red}{Fig.00000} illustrates the experimental scene for our system.
